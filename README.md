TWIDISPLAY
==========

Firmware, Arduino library and avr-gcc library for Akafugu 7-segment TWI display.

Arduino Library
---------------

The Arduino Library is located in the TWIDisplay subdirectory.

To use the library, copy the entire directory into the libraries subdirectory of your Arduino installation.

After doing this, you will have a TWIDisplay submenu inside File -> Examples. Open the simple example and press PLAY to compile it.

To try out the display with an Arduino, hook the wires up as follows:

SDA - Pin A4
SCL - Pin A5
GND - GND
VCC - 5V

After hooking it up, press Upload in the Arduino IDE, and you should see the display count from 0 to 9999.

Firmware
--------

The firmware for the Akafugu 7-segment TWI display is located in the firmware subdirectory.

The display comes pre-flashed with firmware, so it is not neccesary to flash it unless you want to upgrade to a newer version. To flash it you will need a ISP programmer.
